# Australian Exoplanet Workshop 10

The 10th Australian Exoplanet Workshop will be held at the **University of Queensland** from 6-8 November 2024. The AEW conference series brings together Australian researchers working on exoplanets and related topics from both observational and theoretical perspectives.

The workshop will cover all areas in observational, theoretical, and experimental exoplanetary science: we welcome talks on exoplanet surveys and discovery, atmospheric observation and theory, orbital dynamics, protoplanetary discs and planet formation, planetary host stars and star-planet interactions, and solar system planetary science.

Participants are encouraged to give a short presentation on their recent research & research facilities. There will also be an opportunity to discuss strategies for increasing linkages and collaborations to expand this critical research area in the future.
